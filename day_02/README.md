# Day 2
## Thoughts
Got a handle on writing the code and back up to speed with the syntax.
Going to have to restructure and make a working library for functionality I expect to use over and over.
The C++ felt very natural to write. It is actually easier to follow than my python sanity check.
## Attacking the problem
Wanted to get comfortable with `map`s (today `unordered_map`) before I really needed to use them.
Proud of myself for using the circular nature of Rock, Paper, Scissors to determine wins better than 
a ton of if statements and switches.
