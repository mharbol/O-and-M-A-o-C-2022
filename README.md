# Marcus' Branch
This is my branch for Advent of Code. I aim to explore a new part of C++ syntax/programming with
each day of the challenge. Unfortunately, my first day with Mac C++ dev is just getting clang to
work so we'll see how this goes. Each day is its own directory so just go from there. Please forgive
me if there are some other programs in the mix just to make sure my programs are not spitting
out pure nonsense.
## Rollup of Days
### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
Just getting clang to work. Turns out all I had to do was use `clang++`. Oof.
### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)
Becoming familiar with `map` before I really need it.
### [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/3)
Dipping my toes in the water with header files. Decided to do two appreaches to the solution;
one with nested for loops (nice and quick to write) and the other with a hash set to get silky
smooth linear time vibes.
### [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/4)
Really fell of the bandwangon starting on the 4th (only addressing it on the 10th).
Gonna progressivly get back on it attacking the easier parts first.
Order of precidence: custom file iterator, stacks, custom classes.
Day 4 feels like a good start for all this madness.
Probably coming Tuesday the 13th at the earliest.
