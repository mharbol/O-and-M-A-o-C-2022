# Orrin's and Marcus' Advent of Code Repo for 2022
This is our repo for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) [2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).
We're using this repo as an accountabiltiy tool and fun sharing mechanism as we try to get better at (really just learn) C++.
There might be some python thrown in the mix for a sanity check; idk this is our first time trying it out.
None of this code should be considered optimal or taken as an example to follow.
Happy coding!!!
## Organization
The `master` branch is the landing page where we post the days' challenges and host any really
cool things we come up with along the way.
Each programmer gets his own branch ([`orrin-branch`](https://github.com/mharbol/O-and-M-A-o-C-2022/tree/orrin-branch) and
[`marcus-branch`](https://github.com/mharbol/O-and-M-A-o-C-2022/tree/marcus-branch)) because maintaining shared branch over
time is a total nightmare.
Plus we get to format our projects the way we want.
## Daily Challenges
Coming soon...
