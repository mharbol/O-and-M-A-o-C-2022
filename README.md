# Marcus' Branch
This is my branch for Advent of Code. I aim to explore a new part of C++ syntax/programming with
each day of the challenge. Unfortunately, my first day with Mac C++ dev is just getting clang to
work so we'll see how this goes. Each day is its own directory so just go from there. Please forgive
me if there are some other programs in the mix just to make sure my programs are not spitting
out pure nonsense.
## Rollup of Days
### [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1)
Just getting clang to work. Turns out all I had to do was use `clang++`. Oof.
### [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)
Becoming familiar with `map` before I really need it.
