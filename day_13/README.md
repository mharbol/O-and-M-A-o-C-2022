# Day 13
I decided to go hella hard today and made a `NestedListComparitor` tree.
Can override and customize however I want and feel like a better programmer that way.
Not been a fan lately (at the time of writing, at least) of not making parsers and datastructures so this will be fun.
All that I will say is that today's python will be a masterpiece.
