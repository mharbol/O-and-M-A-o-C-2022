# Day 1
## Thoughts
Today I am just getting familiar with syntax and making a funcioning program.
For right now just using g++ and a single source file.
Hopefully will get more comprehesive and reusable as the days go on.
Baby steps...
## Attacking the problem
Have to work early so just read the question this morning.
Looks not too bad - just have to read in the values, add to an accumulator, and keep track of the current max value.
Working with strings in C++ will not be super fun to start.

Got home later than I would have liked to going to do this using an
input file with `fstream`. Not as cool as the original idea to 
do a little `curl <url> | my_program` action but it gets the job done.
We got more days ahead of us.
